<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="images/cello.jpg" alt="Self-portrait of Lindsay holding cello and giving a thumbs up in front of a painting" class="image1">
<p>Hi! My name is Lindsay Taylor. I live in South Bend, Indiana and currently work at St. Joe County Public Library. I have two perfect, cuddly, weird cats, a 98-year-old house, and an awesome spouse who cooks amazing dinners for me while I work full time and take classes (he’s the best). I enjoy taking part in local South Bend events, reading about art and art history, antique-shopping, and as of recently, strength training! I graduated from IU South Bend in 2017 with a BFA in graphic design and printmaking, so the transition to library work has been unexpected but so fun; every day is filled with new experiences and challenges.</p>
<p>I’m pursuing my MLIS through IUPUI’s online program. Currently, I work in the Research & Digital Creation department of my local public library which means I get to work with patrons each day on a variety of queries, from tracking down an obituary on microfilm, to locating book titles in our collection and making library cards, all the way to slicing .stl files to create 3D prints in our digital lab!</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>I am hoping to travel more soon! Ryan and I travel to Chicago a lot since it's so close (as you can see we are on the subway in this photo), but I would love to take a trip abroad in the near future! I won't be joining you all in Finland this year, but someday I hope to visit. I think a trip to the Upper Peninsula in Michigan for an unplugged, relaxing vacation is on the horizon!</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking out this little site of mine! Since I'm a beginner it's not too polished but I learned a lot along the way.</p>
