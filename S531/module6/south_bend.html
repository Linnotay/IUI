<h2>About South Bend</h2>
<img src="images/river.JPEG" alt="A sunset view looking out onto the St. Joseph River through a frame of trees" class="image1">
<p>South Bend is in Indiana, which is in the midwest part of the United States. The area I'm from is sometimes called Michiana because we are so close to Michigan. This means we often get snow and weather patterns blowing in from the Great Lakes, but otherwise we experience all four seasons and they're lovely! My favorite is late spring moving into summer, because there's so many good areas to walk and enjoy the scenery like this photo from Leeper Park.</p>

<h2>Loving the place you're in</h2>
<p>I have lived in South Bend pretty much my whole life and for a long time I wanted to move as far as I could...but now I really enjoy living here! I have lots of friends and family in this town that make it a wonderful place to live.</p>
